# Optimizing Ad Engagement with A/B Testing

This project analyzes ad engagement using click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and engagement duration to evaluate the impact of different ad formats and personalization strategies.

## Project Overview
We ran an A/B test comparing banner vs. video ads and static vs. dynamic personalization to determine which combinations drive the highest engagement and conversions.

## Key Results
- **Dynamic Video ads** had a +17% higher CTR than any other combination.
- Peak engagement occurred **between 10 AM â€“ 1 PM on weekdays**.
- Most users dropped off within **2 minutes**, suggesting retention improvements are needed.
